# Restaurant Page with JavaScript & Webpack

An Odin Project for learning ES6, DOM and webpack etc advance topics in JavaScript.

[Project Demo](https://kelvin8773.github.io/odin-restaurant-page/)


## To Run this Project

* `git clone` this project to your local machine.

* `cd dist/` and open `index.html` to see the final project page.

* To try webpack yourself, run `npx run watch` in project root folder.

* Update Javascript/image files in `src/` folder or `index.html` under `dist/` folder, wait until webpack finish the rebuild and refresh the page to see the result. 


## Note

* The main goal of this project is to learn module in ES6 and webpack configuration for standard project.

* I use ES6 standard for this project, I pack all the pages into separated modules and load as demand.

* I use WebPack to help pack JavaScript, CSS and Images files into production ready packages.

* With the help of DOM manipulations, user can dynamically click through different pages without the need to reload the whole website.
