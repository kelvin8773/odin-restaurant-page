# odin-restaurant-page

An Odin Project for learning ES6, DOM and webpack etc advance topics in JavaScript.


## Note

* The main goal of this project is to learn module in ES6 and webpack configuration for standard project.

* I use ES6 standard for this project, I pack all the pages into separated modules and load as demand.

* I use WebPack to help pack JavaScript, CSS and Images files into production ready packages.

* With the help of DOM manipulations, user can dynamically click through different pages without the need to reload the whole website.
